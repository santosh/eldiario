# Contributing

To get started with development, clone the repo if no already.

    git clone https://github.com/santosh/eldiario.git

Tip #2: Establish proper contributing guidelines
A well-written Contributing.md can describe the workflow your project’s maintainers expected contributors to follow. This is easy to document, and will save both sides a significant amount of time.

Specify whether the contributor is required to work on a separate branch for each issue, or to squash their commits and rebase their changes before submitting a PR. Try to link to an appropriate tutorials for each of these processes in case the contributor isn’t yet familiar with them.
